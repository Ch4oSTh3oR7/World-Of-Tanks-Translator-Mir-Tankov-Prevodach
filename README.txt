A simple tool for world of tanks or мир танков (mir tankov / tanki) from wargaming or lesta respectivelly. 

It is a simple script that will translate the game files ( no pictures or audio) into the language of your choice. If you desire to play on the russian branch of the game and dont understand russian you can change it with this script.
It uses google translate as its a free API that you dont have to pay with but it has some jank with certain translations.

How to use:

You can watch the youtube video here:

1 - Grab the required MO files
2 - Get the required libraries and python version 3+ (you can find many good tutorials on youtube)
3 - Install Poelib in an easily accessable directory
4 - Open the file in Edit mode and change the languages as you want and the path to Poedit
5 - Create a folder next to the python file and name it "Input_MO" and paste the from the "World_of_Tanks_EU\res\text\lc_messages" for lesta "World_of_Tanks_RU\res\text\ru\lc_messages"
6 - Create a backup of the original .MO files just to be safe.
7 - Now you can run the .PY, if no errors this process should take around 5 - 10 minutes depending on your internet and google translate
8 - Copy the files from the "Finished_Mo" folder and replace the original ones
9 - Now you can just run the game in your prefered language. Keep in mind an update to the game will replace some of these files and you have to do it again unless the translation is made into a .wotmod


You can take a look at the older or separate files if you wish to do so - Run order is Convert -> Translate -> Recompile
I am not good at coding so a lot was written with chatGPT in python
